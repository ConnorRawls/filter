# filter
This is a repo containing my solution to cs50's filter problem ---> https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/less/

Everything is functional except the blur section. I am recieving a memory error. Unsure of what's causing this or a solution. Possibly due to calling NULL values, memory leaks, or heap overflow.
